In the summer of 2020 I took a GIS course based in R, where I learned how to write code. Here is a collection of links to some of the projects I've created: 

****

### [Building a project website](https://mikaleslie.github.io/index.html)

- In this assignment we built this static users site with Github Pages
- We learned what a yml file is, and how to edit one
- We created the basic files required for a website, including an index page and this page, and how to add them to a navbar

****

### [Data Wrangling: Manipulating Live Covid-19 Pandemic Data](https://mikaleslie.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-02.html)

- In this assignment we worked with live data from the Covid-19 pandemic sourced from the NYT
- We learned how to make tables and graphs with ggplot and knitr
- We also worked on data.frame manipulation and joining datasets

This image was produced using NYT covid-19 data and shows daily new cases in four states, as well as the seven day rolling mean.

### [Projections, Distances, and Mapping](https://mikaleslie.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-03.html)

- In this assignment we began working with simple features objects and geos measures
- Emphasis was placed on feature aggregations (combines/unions); coordinate references systems; and distance measurements
- We also learned how to map geometric features and use aesthetic tools such as gghighlight

This map is a culmination of data analysis throughout the lab, and the application of mapping tools such as gghhighlight and ggrepel.

### [Tesselations, Spatial Joins, and Point-in-Polygon: Working with the National Dams Inventory](https://mikaleslie.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-04.html)

- In this assignment we learned about geometry simplication, centroid generation, and tesselations
- We used tesselations to explore the distribution of dams (and dam purpose) across the USA and challenges with the MAUP
- Functions were implemented to automate repetitive tasks

This image shows density of dam locations in a CONUS projection using a voronoi tesselation.

### [Raster Analysis and Remote Sensing](https://mikaleslie.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-05.html)

- In this assignment we worked with multiband raster files to detect and analyze a flood event near Palo, Iowa.
-  We practiced accessing and analysing data from Landsat 8 satellite. 
- We learned about how different wavelengths can highlight different features via different combinations in the RGB channels.
- We also practiced raster analysis using raster algebra and thresholding.

This image shows five unique thresholding methods for delineating surface water features, created using different combinations of Landsat bands.

### [Terrain Analysis: Flood Risk in Mission Creek](https://mikaleslie.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-06.html)

- In this assignment we estimated the number of buildings impacted in the 2017 Santa Barbara flood event along Mission Creek using data from web APIs (NLDI, OSM, AWS Elevation tiles).
- We practiced accessing OSM data using the correct keys and values.
- We used the whitebox frontend to generate a Height Above Nearest Drainage layer for the Mission Creek watershed.
- This flood data was cross analyzed with the OSM data to identify and map impacted buildings.
